# Words App

This is a modified version of the first Words app I created using intents and activity. 
This time I created it using single activity, fragments and nav graph.
Using Fragments helps pass the data between screens in a safer way and adapts to different device configurations


# Introduction
Words app allows you to select a letter and use Intents to navigate to an Activity that
presents a number of words starting with that letter. Each word can be looked up via a web search.

Words app contains a scrollable list of 26 letters A to Z in a RecyclerView. The orientation
of the RecyclerView can be changed between a vertical list or a grid of items.
